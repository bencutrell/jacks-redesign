Steps necessary to begin to edit website:

1. Download Visual Studio Code Editor
2. Create Github account
3. Get an invite to the Malibu Jack's website code repository from repository maintainer

Editing site content:

    To view file as you edit:

        1. Download .html file that you want to work on
            A. Click on jacks-redesign repository
            B. Right click on Raw
            C. Save as or save link as
        2. Save to folder located directly in home or root directory
            Meaning not inside of another folder
            This is almost certainly C:// if you are using Windows
            The folder should be visible next to Documents, Pictures, Users, etc
        3. Open .html file with Visual Studio Code
        4. In the .html file near the top will be a .css file mentioned in a <link> element
        5. Download it from Github and save in the same file as the .html file
            *IMPORTANT NOTE* Sometimes Windows will not save .css files correctly. If your computer does
            not add a .css extension and tries to save as a .txt file select save as type: All files and type in
            .css after the file name yourself. If you see that your computer saved the file wrong you can 
            download the file again with the above added step to save correctly
        6. In the .html file near the very bottom in a <script> element a .js file will be mentioned
        7. Download it from Github and save in the same file as the .html file
        8. For pictures to display correctly create a file within the file used above and title it
        JacksImages
            *OPTIONAL* for images to display correctly
            *SUGGESTED* only do this on a Malibu Jack's work computer as image files can require significant amount of memory
            *NOTE* The only downside to not having pictures as you edit is that you do not see them as you edit
        9. Either download the specific files located in <img> elements on the .html file or download the 
        entire jacksImages folder
        10. Open .html file using Visual Studio Code
        11. Drag .html file into a Chrome tab from File Explorer, VSC, or equivelant
        12. When you save a change to a file refresh your Chrome tab and the changes should be reflected

    Alternatively you can just edit files within Github
